# Ubuntu User Management Guide

## 1. Creating a New User in One Command

To create a new user with a home directory, default shell (`/bin/bash`), and a predefined password:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -p $(openssl passwd -1 "YourPassword") username
```

### **Explanation:**
- `sudo` → Runs the command with administrative privileges.
- `useradd` → Creates a new user.
- `-m` → Automatically creates a home directory (`/home/username`).
- `-s /bin/bash` → Sets `/bin/bash` as the default shell.
- `-p $(openssl passwd -1 "YourPassword")` → Encrypts the password before setting it (MD5-based encryption).
- `username` → Replace this with the desired username.

> ⚠️ **Note:** It's recommended to use `sudo passwd username` after creation to securely set the password instead of passing it in plain text.

## 2. Adding a User to the Docker Group

If you want the user to run Docker commands without `sudo`, add them to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker username
```

### **Explanation:**
- `sudo` → Runs the command with administrative privileges.
- `usermod` → Modifies user properties.
- `-aG docker` → Appends (`-a`) the user to the `docker` group (`-G` stands for group).
- `username` → Replace this with the actual username.

> 🔄 **Changes take effect after logout and login** or running `newgrp docker`.

## 3. Deleting an Existing User with All Resources

To remove a user along with their home directory, mail spool, and other related files:

```bash
sudo userdel -r username
```

### **Explanation:**
- `sudo` → Runs the command with administrative privileges.
- `userdel` → Deletes a user.
- `-r` → Removes the home directory and mail spool (`/var/mail/username`).
- `username` → Replace with the actual username.

> 🚨 **Warning:** This action is irreversible! All user files and configurations will be deleted.

## Additional Tips
- List all users:
  ```bash
  cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
  ```
- Check a user’s groups:
  ```bash
  groups username
  ```
- Forcefully terminate all processes of a user before deletion:
  ```bash
  sudo pkill -u username
  ```
